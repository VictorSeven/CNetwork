CNetwork
========

CNetwork is a simple C++ class to do network analysis. Features:

- Get node properties, such as degree, clustering, or distance between nodes.
- Functions to create well known networks, such as Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barabási-Albert or any scale-free distribution using the configuration model.
- Functions to manually add or remove nodes and links, as well as accessing them. 
- Support for import/export functions.

The aim of this simple class is to have .cpp file which can be imported in any project, without having to compile any source code. The code run fast and allows the user to do data analysis with networks of decent sizes (~10<sup>6</sup>). 
See the wiki (WIP) for details in the functions and examples.
